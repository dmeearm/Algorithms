DES encode and decode tools

1. run "Makefile"

2. you can get two execute file: "des_encrypt" that is for encode and    
   "des_decrypt" used for decode.

3. if you want to encode a plain text, run "./des_encrypt" with two   
   arguments: the secret key and plain text that would be encode.
   eg: ./des_encrypt 12345678 plaintext

4. if you want to decrypt a ciphertext. it should do the same thing like 
   "des_encrypt", but the second argument is ciphertext of the two arguments

   Good Luck!
